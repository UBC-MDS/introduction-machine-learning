By the end of the module, students are expected to:

- Explain the notion of similarity-based algorithms.
- Broadly describe how 𝑘-NNs use distances.
- Describe the effect of using a small/large value of the hyperparameter 𝑘 when using the 𝑘-NN algorithm.
- Explain the problem of curse of dimensionality.
- Explain the general idea of SVMs with RBF kernel.
- Compare and contrast 𝑘-NNs and SVM RBFs.
- Broadly describe the relation of `gamma` and `C` hyperparameters with the fundamental tradeoff.
