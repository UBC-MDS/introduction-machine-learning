## Module Learning Outcomes

By the end of the module, students are expected to:

- Explain `handle_unknown="ignore"` hyperparameter of `scikit-learn`'s `OneHotEncoder`.
- Identify when it's appropriate to apply ordinal encoding vs one-hot encoding.
- Explain strategies to deal with categorical variables with too many categories.
- Explain why text data needs a different treatment than categorical variables.
- Use `scikit-learn`'s `CountVectorizer` to encode text data.
- Explain different hyperparameters of `CountVectorizer`.
- Use `ColumnTransformer` to build all our transformations together into one object and use it with `scikit-learn` pipelines.
