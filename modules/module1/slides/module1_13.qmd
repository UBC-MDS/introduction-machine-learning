## Supervised Learning (Reminder)

- Tabular data → Machine learning algorithm → ML model → new examples → predictions

:::{.notes}
To recap what we have seen so far in supervised machine learning we are given some training data. 

We separate our data into features (`X`) and target (`y`), we feed it to our learning algorithm, then the learning algorithm learns some function which we call our machine learning model and we use this to predict the target on unseen test examples.

## Building a simplest machine learning model using sklearn

Baseline model:          

**most frequent baseline**: always predicts the most frequent label in the training set.



:::{.notes}
Let’s build a baseline, a simple machine learning algorithm based on simple rules.

We are going to build a most frequent baseline model which always predicts the most frequently labeled in the training set.

We make baseline models not to use for prediction purposes, but as a reference point when we are building other more sophisticated models.  
:::

---

## Data 

```{python}
classification_df = pd.read_csv("data/quiz2-grade-toy-classification.csv")
classification_df.head()
```



:::{.notes}
Let's take our data. 

For this example, we are going to be working with the quiz2 classification data that we have seen previously. 

In this dataset, we have 7 features with our target column being `quiz2` which has 2 possible values; `A+` or `Not A+`. 
:::

---

## 1. Create  𝑋  and  𝑦

𝑋  → Feature vectors <br>
𝑦  → Target

```{python}
X = classification_df.drop(columns=["quiz2"])
y = classification_df["quiz2"]
```


:::{.notes}
Whenever we build models, there are several important steps involved. 

Our first step in building our model is splitting up our tabular data into the features and the target, also known as 𝑋 and 𝑦. 

𝑋 is all of our features in our data, which we also call our ***feature table***. <br>
𝑦 is our target, which is what we are predicting.

For this problem, all the columns in our dataframe except `quiz2` make up our 𝑋 and the `quiz2` column, which is our target make up our 𝑦.

## 2. Create a classifier object

- `import` the appropriate classifier. 
- Create an object of the classifier. 

```{python}
from sklearn.dummy import DummyClassifier

dummy_clf = DummyClassifier(strategy="most_frequent")
```


:::{.notes}
Our next step is creating a model object. 

To make our baseline model, we need to import the necessary library.

We spoke about the Scikit Learn package in the last slide deck and we are using the same package to build our baseline model. 

Here we are importing `DummyClassifier()` which will be used to create our baseline model. 

We specify in the `strategy` argument `most_frequent` which means our model will always predict the most frequent label in the training set. 

Here we are naming our model `dummy_clf`.
:::

---

## 3. Fit the classifier

```{python results = 'hide'}
dummy_clf.fit(X, y)
```


:::{.notes}
Next, we fit the classifier.

When we call fit on our model object, the actual learning happens. In our simple model there is not much to learn and in this case, will only learn what the most frequent label is in our training data. 
:::

---

## 4. Predict the target of given examples

We can predict the target of examples by calling `predict` on the classifier object. 

Let's see what it predicts for a single observation first:<br>
```{python}
single_obs = X.loc[[0]]
single_obs
```

<br>

```{python}
dummy_clf.predict(single_obs)
```

:::{.notes}

Once we have our learned model, the next thing we can do is predict using it!

First, we will predict a single observation. 
We call our model `dummy_clf` on the object and we get a prediction of `Not A+` for it. 
:::

---

```{python}
X
```

<br>

```{python}
dummy_clf.predict(X)
```


:::{.notes}
We can also predict on many examples. 

Here, we are predicting on all of `X`. 

And if we see the predictions for all the observations in `X`, the model predicts a value of `not A+` for each one.

That’s because `Not A+` is the most frequent label in our training set. 

We will talk more about `.fit()` and `.predict()` in the next module.  
:::

---

## 5. Scoring your model

In the classification setting, `.score()` gives the accuracy of the model, i.e., proportion of correctly predicted observations. 

![](../../../static/module1/predit_total.gif){fig-align="center"}

Sometimes you will also see people reporting error, which is usually  1−𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 

![](../../../static/module1/error.gif){fig-align="center"}

```{python}
print("The accuracy of the model on the training data:", (round(dummy_clf.score(X, y), 3)))
```

<br>

```{python}
print("The error of the model on the training data:", (round(1 - dummy_clf.score(X, y), 3)))
```

:::{.notes}
It's at this point where we can see how well our baseline model predicts the `quiz2` value.  

In ML models, very often it is not possible to get 100% accuracy.
How do we check how well our model is doing?

In the classification setting, `score()` gives the accuracy of the model, i.e., the proportion of correctly predicted examples.

Sometimes we will also see people reporting error, which is usually 1 - accuracy. 

We can see that our model's accuracy on our `quiz2` problem is 0.524. 

We could also say the error is 0.476.

## fit and predict paradigms

The general pattern when we build ML models using `sklearn`: 

1. Creating your 𝑋 and 𝑦 objects 
2. `clf = DummyClassifier()` &rarr; create a model (here we are naming it `clf`)  
3. `clf.fit(X, y)` &rarr; train the model 
4. `clf.score(X, y)` &rarr; assess the model
5. `clf.predict(Xnew)` &rarr; predict on some new data using the trained model 

:::{.notes}
To summarize, here are the steps we follow when building machine learning models using `sklearn`.<br><br>
1. Create our 𝑋 and 𝑦 objects<br>
2. Create our model object ( in this case, we created a dummy classifier)<br>
3. Fit our model<br>
4. Assess our model<br>
5. Predict on new examples using this model.<br>
