    There are two main kinds of supervised learning problems based on what they are trying to predict; ***Classification*** and ***Regression***.

## Classification vs. Regression

- **Classification problem**: predicting among two or more categories, also known as classes
    - *Example1*: Predict whether a patient has a liver disease or not
    - *Example2*: Predict whether the letter grade of a student (A,B,C,D or F)

- **Regression problem**: predicting a continuous (in other words, a number) value
    - Example1: Predict housing prices
    - Example2: Predict a student's score in this course's quiz2


:::{.notes}
 In **Classification** problems we predict target value among two or more known categories.

For example:

- Whether a patient has a liver disease or not (2 possible target values)
- The letter grade of a student: A, B, C, D or F. (There are 5 categories)

**Regression** predicts a continuous (typically, floating-point) value.

For example:

- Housing prices
- The scores of students in this course's quiz2.

:::{.notes} 
Here are examples of classification and regression problems. 

As we said before in a classification problem the target has discrete categories. 
In this example, our target has only two possible values; A+ or not A+. Our goal is to predict if a student will get a value of A+ or not A+. 

In Regression problems, we are predicting each studentâ€™s grade, so the target here which is quiz2 contains the actual students' score.

```{python}
classification_df = pd.read_csv("data/quiz2-grade-toy-classification.csv")
classification_df.head()
```


:::{.notes}
We have created two toy datasets for classification and regression and this is our toy dataset for classification. 

We can see in the first example, the target here is `quiz2` and contains only 2 possible values; A+ or not A+.
:::

---

```{python}
regression_df = pd.read_csv("data/quiz2-grade-toy-regression.csv")
regression_df.head()
```


:::{.notes} 
On the other hand, in the regression problem, the target column (`quiz2`) contains the actual scores so we have continuous values in our `quiz2` column.
