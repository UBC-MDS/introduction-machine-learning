## Candybars

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code. Run it and see if you obtain the desired output. Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question. We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_

### Describing a Dataset

Let's make sure we understand all the components we use in a dataset for machine learning. The packages you need will be loaded for you. In this example we would be attempting to predict the country availability of candy bars, which makes the column `availability` the target.

```{pyodide}
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.dummy import DummyClassifier

candybar_df = pd.read_csv('data/candybars.csv')
candybar_df
```

**Task:**<br>

- Save the dimensions of the dataframe in an object named `candybar_dim`.<br>

```{pyodide}
#| setup: true
#| exercise: describing_a_dataset

import pandas as pd
from src.utils import assert_equal

candybar_df = pd.read_csv('data/candybars.csv')
```


```{pyodide}
#| exercise: describing_a_dataset
candybar_dim = candybar_df.____

candybar_dim
```


```{pyodide}
#| exercise: describing_a_dataset
#| check: true

assert_equal(candybar_df.shape, result, "Did you save the dimensions to candybar_dim?")
```

:::: { .hint exercise="describing_a_dataset"}
::: { .callout-note collapse="false"}

## Hint 1

- Are you using `.shape` to find the dimensions? 

:::
::::

:::: { .solution exercise="describing_a_dataset" }
::: { .callout-tip collapse="false"}

## Fully worked solution:
```{pyodide}
print(candybar_df.head())

candybar_dim = candybar_df.shape
candybar_dim
```
