## Questions on Why

<div id='mcq1'></div>
<script>
    generateQuiz(
        'mcq1',
        'Question 1',
        'Which model will still produce meaningful predictions with different scaled column values?',
        {
        'Decision Trees': 'You are right! Decision Trees visit a single feature at a time, unlike ùëò-NN models, which calculate distances using the features all together.',
        'ùëò-NN': 'This works in a similar way to SVM, where distance is calculated and features are observed together and not independently of each other.',
        'SVM': 'This works in a similar way to ùëò-NN, where distance is calculated and features are observed together and not independently of each other.',
        },

    );

<div id='mcq2'></div>
<script>
    generateQuiz(
        'mcq2',
        'Complete the following statement',
        'Preprocessing is done ____.',
        {
        'To the model before training': 'It is done before training but not to the model.',
        'To the data before training the model': '',
        'To the model after training': 'It‚Äôs not done to the model or after training.',
        'To the data after training the model': 'You are half right, but it‚Äôs not done after training the model.',
        },
        'To the data before training the model',
    );

## Motivation True and False

<div id='mcq3'></div>
<script>
    generateQuiz(
        'mcq3',
        'Question 1',
        'Columns with lower magnitudes compared to columns with higher magnitudes are less important when making predictions.',
        {
        'True': 'These types of models find examples that are most similar to the text example in the <i>training</i> set.',
        'False': 'Great! Just because a feature has smaller values does not mean it‚Äôs less informative.',
        },
        'False',
    );
</script>

<div id='mcq4'></div>
<script>
    generateQuiz(
        'mcq4',
        'Question 2',
        'A model less sensitive to the scale of the data makes it more robust.',
        {
        'True': 'Nailed it!',
        'False': 'Models that are more sensitive to scale can be problematic.',
        },
        'True',
    );

## Preprocessing Questions

<div id='mcq5'></div>
<script>
    generateQuiz(
        'mcq5',
        'Question 1',
        '<code>StandardScaler</code> is a type of what?',
        {
        'Converter': 'You are close but the terminology is not correct.',
        'Categorizer': 'Not quite.',
        'Model': 'We are not modeling with <code>StandardScaler</code> since it is <i>transforming</i> the data and not predicting on it.',
        'Transformer': '',
        },
        'Transformer',
    );
</script>

<div id='mcq6'></div>
<script>
    generateQuiz(
        'mcq6',
        'Question 2',
        'What data does <code>StandardScaler</code> alter?',
        {
        'Training only': 'It definitely alters the training set but that‚Äôs not all.',
        'Testing only': 'It does alter the test data but it doesn‚Äôt stop there.',
        'Both training and testing': '',
        'Nether training or testing': 'We need to scale our data though!',
        },
        'Both training and testing',
    );
