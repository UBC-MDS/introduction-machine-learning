## Decision Boundaries Part 2

For the following questions, refer to this diagram below.

We are trying to predict a player’s position in this problem:

- Blue circles represent defense players
- Red triangles represent forward players

## Decision Boundaries Part 3

Use the plot below to answer the following questions.

![](../../static/module2/hockey_q.png){fig-align="center" width="60%" fig-alt="404 image"}

We are trying to predict a player's position in this problem:

- Blue circles represent defense players
- Red triangles represent forward players

**Question**       
Given this plot, which tree diagram is best represented by the decision boundaries? 

A.
