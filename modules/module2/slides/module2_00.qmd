## Module Learning Outcomes

By the end of the module, students are expected to:

- Broadly describe how decision trees make predictions.
- Use `DecisionTreeClassifier()` and `DecisionTreeRegressor()` to build decision trees using scikit-learn.
- Explain the `.fit()` and `.predict()` paradigm and use `.score()` method of ML models.
- Explain the concept of decision boundaries.
- Explain the difference between parameters and hyperparameters.
- Explain how decision boundaries change with `max_depth`.
- Explain the concept of generalization.
