    This module will introduce why and how we split our data into a training and a test test and how cross validation works on our training data. We will also explain the fundamental trade off as well as the golden rule of machine learning.

## Module Learning Outcomes

By the end of the module, students are expected to:

- Split a dataset into train and test sets using `train_test_split` function.
- Explain the difference between train, validation, test, and "deployment" data.
- Identify the difference between training error, validation error, and test error.
- Explain cross-validation and use `cross_val_score()` and `cross_validate()` to calculate cross-validation error.
- Explain overfitting, underfitting, and the fundamental tradeoff.
- State the golden rule and identify the scenarios when it's violated.
