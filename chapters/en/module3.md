<exercise id="4" title="Splitting Data in Action">

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question.  We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_

Let's split our data using `train_test_split()` on our candy bars dataset.

Tasks:     

- Split the `X` and `y` dataframes into 4 objects: `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, `y_test`. 
- Make the test set 0.2 (or the train set 0.8) and make sure to use `random_state=7`. 
- Build a model using `DecisionTreeClassifier()`. 
- Save this in an object named `model`. 
- Fit your model on the objects `X_train` and `y_train`.
- Evaluate the accuracy of the model using `.score()` on `X_train` and `y_train` save the values in an object named `train_score`.
- Repeat the above action but this time evaluate the accuracy of the model using `.score()` on `X_test` and `y_test` (which the model has never seen before) and save the values in an object named `test_score`. 

<codeblock id="03_04">

**Question 1**

Let's examine our validation scores and training scores a bit more carefully and assess if our model is underfitting or overfitting.

This time we are looking at a new data set that contains the basketball players in the NBA. We are only going to use the players with a position of Guard (G) or Forward (F).  We will be using features height, weight and salary to try to predict the player's position, Guard or Forward.

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question.  We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_

Let's take a look at the basketball dataset we saw in exercise 16. We will again be using features height, weight and salary and a target column `position`..  This time , however, let's cross-validate on different values for max_depth so we can set this hyperparameter and build a final model that best generalizes on our test set. 

First let's see which hyperparameter is the most optimal. 

Tasks:     

- Fill in the code below. 
- We are first loading in our `bball.csv` dataset and assigning our features to `X` and our target `position` to an object named `y`. 
- Fill in the code so that it split the dataset into `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, `y_test`. Make sure to use a 20% test set and a `random_state=33` so we can verify you solution.
- Next, fill in the code so that a `for` loop does the following:

  1. iterates over the values 1-20.
    - Builds a decision tree classifier with a `max_depth` equal to each iteration.
    - Uses `cross_validate` on the model with a `cv=10` and `return_train_score=True`.
    - Appends the depth value to the `depth` list in the dictionary `results_dict`.
    - Appends the `test_score` to the `mean_cv_score` list in the dictionary. 
    - Appends the `train_score` to the `mean_train_score` list in the dictionary. 
- We have given you code that wrangles this dictionary and transforms it into a state ready for plotting.
- Finish off by filling in the blank to create a line graph that plots the train and validation scores for each depth value. 
(Note: we have edited the limits of the y-axis so it's easier to read)

<codeblock id="03_20a">

- Are you using `train_test_split()` to split the data?
- Are you splitting with either `test_size=0.2` or `train_size=0.8`? 
- Are you setting your `random_state=33` inside `train_test_split()`?
- Are you using `DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=depth)` to build the model?
- Are you using `cross_validate(model, X_train, y_train, cv=10, return_train_score=True)`?
- Are you using `alt.Chart(results_df).mark_line()` to create your plot?

**Question 1**    
To which depth would you set your `max_depth` hyperparameter?

<choice id="1" >
<opt text="1" >

There are other depth values that have a higher cross-validation score that at this value. 

</opt>

<opt text="4" correct="true">

Are you sure this is the depth with the highest cross-validation score possible?

</opt>


</choice>


Now that we have found a suitable value for `max_depth` let's build a new model and let this hyperparameter value. How well does your model do on the test data?

Tasks:     

- Build a model using `DecisionTreeClassifier()` using the optimal `max_depth`. 
- Save this in an object named `model`. 
- Fit your model on the objects `X_train` and `y_train`.
- Evaluate the test score of the model using `.score()` on `X_test` and `y_test` and save the values in an object named `test_score` rounded to 4 decimal places.

<codeblock id="03_20b">

- Are using `DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=4)`?
- Are you using the model named `model`?
- Are you calling `.fit(X_train, y_train)` on your model?

- Are you rounding to 4 decimal places?
- Are you calculating `test_score` as  `round(model.score(X_test, y_test), 4)` )
