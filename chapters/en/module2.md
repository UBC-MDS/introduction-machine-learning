<exercise id="7" title="Building a Decision Tree Classifier">

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question.  We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_

Let's build a decision tree classifier using `DecisionTreeClassifier()`. 

Tasks:     

- Build a model using `DecisionTreeClassifier()` and make sure to set the `random_state` argument to 1. 
- Save this in an object named `model`. 
- Fit your model on the objects `X` and `y`.
- Predict on `X` and save the values in an object named `predicted`.
- Compare the `availability` column to the `predicted` column and answer the multiple-choice questions below. 

<codeblock id="02_07">

- Are using `DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=1)`?
- Are you using the model named `model`?
- Are you calling `.fit(X,y)` on your model?

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes.

Let's build a decision tree classifier using `DecisionTreeClassifier()` but this time, let's set some different hyperparameters.

Tasks:     

- Build a decision tree classifier and make sure to set the argument `random_state` to 1. 
- Set the `max_depth` of the tree to 8 and the `min_samples_split` to 4. 
- Save the model in an object named `hyper_tree`. 
- Fit your model on the objects `X` and `y`.
- Save the accuracy of the model rounded to 2 decimal places in a variable named `tree_score` and display it.

<codeblock id="02_15">

- Are using `DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=8, min_samples_split=4, random_state=1)`?
- Are you using the model named `hyper_tree`?
- Are you calling `.fit(X,y)` on your model?
- Are you using `.score(X,y)` and rounding to 2 decimal places by using `round()`?

</codeblock>



**Question 1**    
Will increasing the value of `max_depth` increase or decrease the accuracy of the model?

<choice id="1" >
<opt text="Increase"  correct="true">

Increasing the depth of the tree will increase the accuracy of the model.

</opt>

<opt text="Decrease" >

Maybe test it out above and see what happens?

</opt>

<opt text="Either increase or decrease"  >

Maybe test it out above and see what happens?

</opt>


</choice>

**Question 2**    
Will increasing the value of `min_samples_split` increase or decrease the accuracy of the model?

<choice id="2" >
<opt text="Increase" >

Maybe test it out above and see what happens?

</opt>

<opt text="Decrease"  correct="true">

Increasing the minimum number of samples needed to split on a feature will decrease the accuracy.

</opt>

<opt text="Either increase or decrease"  >

Maybe test it out above and see what happens?

</opt>


</choice>

**Question 3**     
Will increasing the value of `max_depth` and `min_samples_split` increase or decrease the accuracy of the model?

<choice id="3" >
<opt text="Increase" >

Are we 100% sure? Increasing `max_depth` will increase the accuracy but increasing `min_samples_split` will decrease it. 

</opt>

<opt text="Decrease" >

Are we 100% sure? Increasing `max_depth` will increase the accuracy but increasing `min_samples_split` will decrease it. 

</opt>

<opt text="Either increase or decrease"   correct="true">

Right! It's hard to say since increasing `max_depth` will increase the accuracy but increasing `min_samples_split` will decrease it.
