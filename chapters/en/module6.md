title: "Module 6: Preprocessing Categorical Variables"
description:
  "This module will teach you different encoding methods for categorical variables (ordinal and one-hot encoding) and appropriately set them up. We will also introduce ColumnTransformer and CountVectorizer from the sklearn library and show you how to implement them."

<opt text="" correct="true">

Great!

</opt>

<opt text="">

We must split our data before we do anything else.

</opt>

<opt text="">

This is a little too late. 

</opt>

<opt text="">

It's a better idea to do it as soon as possible.

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question.  We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_
