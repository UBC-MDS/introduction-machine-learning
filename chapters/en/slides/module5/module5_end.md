# Module Learning Outcomes

By the end of the module, students are expected to:

- Identify when to implement feature transformations such as imputation and scaling.
- Apply `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` to build a machine learning pipeline.
- Use `sklearn` for applying numerical feature transformations on the data.
- Discuss the golden rule in the context of feature transformations.
- Carry out hyperparameter optimization using `sklearn`'s `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`.
- Explain overfitting on the validation set.



Notes: 

The assignment will concentrate on the learning objectives as well as building knowledge on existing concepts.
