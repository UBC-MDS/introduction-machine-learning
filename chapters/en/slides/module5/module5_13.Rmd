```

```{python}

```
```{python}
knn = KNeighborsRegressor()
knn.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train);
knn.score(X_train_scaled, y_train).round(3)
```

Notes: 

We left off with our scaled data and calculated our training score, however in the last module we saw that cross-validation is a useful way to get a realistic assessment of the model. 

We don’t want to keep touching our test set like we have been doing, so we really should be using cross-validation instead. 


---

### How to carry out cross-validation? 

```{python}
knn = KNeighborsRegressor()
scores = cross_validate(knn, X_train_scaled, y_train, return_train_score=True)
pd.DataFrame(scores)
```

Notes: 

Let's try cross-validation with transformed data. 

**Is there a problem here?**

We are using our `X_train_scaled` in our `cross_validate()` function which already has all our preprocessing done. 

Let’s bring back the golden rule where ***Our test data should not influence our training data*** and this applies also to our validation data and that it also should not influence our training data. 

Our first instinct to develop good habits is to split our data first however when we use the `cross_validate()` function, since we are scaling first and then splitting into training and validation, information from our validation data is influencing our training data now. 

With imputation and scaling, we are scaling and imputing values based on all the information in the data meaning the training data AND the validation data and so we are not adhering to the golden rule anymore. 

Every row in our `x_train_scaled` has now been influenced in a minor way by every other row in `x_train_scaled`. 

With scaling every row has been transformed based on all the data before splitting between training and validation. 

Here we said that we allowed information from the validation set to **leak** into the training step.

We need to take care that we are keeping our validation data truly as unseen data. 

Before we look at the right approach to this, it's important to look at the wrong approaches and understand why we cannot perform cross-validation in such ways. 


---

### Bad methodology 1: Scaling the data separately

```{python}
scaler = StandardScaler();
scaler.fit(X_train_imp);
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train_imp)
```

```{python results='Hide'}
# Creating a separate object for scaling test data - Not a good idea.
scaler = StandardScaler();
scaler.fit(X_test_imp); # Calling fit on the test data - Yikes! 
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test_imp) # Transforming the test data using the scaler fit on test data ... Bad! 
```

```{python}
knn = KNeighborsRegressor()
knn.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train);
print("Training score: ", knn.score(X_train_scaled, y_train).round(2))
print("Test score: ", knn.score(X_test_scaled, y_test).round(2))
```

Notes: 

The first mistake that often occurs is as follows. 

We make our transformer, we fit it on the training data and then transform the training data. 

Next, we make a second transformer, fit it on the test data and then transform our test data.

***What is wrong with this approach?***

Although we are keeping our test data separate from our training data, by scaling the train and test splits separately, we are using two different `StandardScaler` objects. 

This is bad because we want to apply the same transformation on the training and test splits.

The test data will have different values than the training data producing a different transformation than the training data. 

In summary, we should never fit on test data, whether it’s to build a model or with a transforming, test data should never be exposed to the `fit` function. 


---

### Bad methodology 2: Scaling the data together

```{python}
X_train_imp.shape, X_test_imp.shape
```

```{python}
# Join the train and test sets back together
X_train_imp_df = pd.DataFrame(X_train_imp,columns=X_train.columns, index=X_train.index)
X_test_imp_df = pd.DataFrame(X_test_imp,columns=X_test.columns, index=X_test.index)
XX = pd.concat([X_train_imp_df, X_test_imp_df], axis = 0) ## Don't do it! 
XX.shape 
```
```{python}
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(XX);
XX_scaled = scaler.transform(XX) 
XX_train, XX_test = XX_scaled[:18576], XX_scaled[18576:]
```



Notes: 

The next mistake is when we scale the data together. So instead of splitting our data, we are combining our training and testing and scaling it together. 

***What is wrong with this second approach?***

Here we are scaling the train and test splits together.

The golden rule says that the test data shouldn't influence the training in any way. 

With this approach, we are using the information from the test split when we `fit` the scalar and calculate the mean. 

This means that the test data is being used when setting up the transformations so, it's **in violation** of the golden rule.  

 
---

```{python}
knn = KNeighborsRegressor()
knn.fit(XX_train, y_train);
print('Train score: ', (knn.score(XX_train, y_train).round(2))) # Misleading score
print('Test score: ', (knn.score(XX_test, y_test).round(2))) # Misleading score
```


Notes: 

These values are showing misleading scores because of this bad approach.

### So, what can we do? 

 We can create a <a href="ttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html" target="_blank">scikit-learn Pipeline</a>!   
 
Pipelines allow us to define a "pipeline" of transformers with a final estimator.

Notes: 


To get around these issues, we introduce a new tool called **pipelines**. 



---

## Let's see it in action

```{python}
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
```

```{python}
pipe = Pipeline([
        ("imputer", SimpleImputer(strategy="median")),
        ("scaler", StandardScaler()),
        ("reg", KNeighborsRegressor())
])
```

Notes: 

A **pipeline** is a sklearn function that contains a sequence of steps. 

Essentially we give it all the actions we want to do with our data such as transformers and models and the pipeline will execute them in steps. 

In this example, we instruct the pipeline to first do imputation using `SimpleImputer()` using a strategy of “median”, next to scale our data using `StandardScaler` and then build a `KNeighborsRegressor`. 

The last step should be a **model/classifier/regressor**.

All the earlier steps should be **transformers**.

This will help obey the golden rule. 


---

```{python}
pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

What's happening:
```python
imputer.fit(X_train)
X_train_imp = imputer.transform(X_train)
scaler.fit(X_train_imp)
X_train_imp_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train_imp)
knn.fit(X_train_imp_scaled)
```


Notes: 

When we call `pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)`, multiple steps are occurring. 

Notice that we are passing `X_train` and **not** the imputed or scaled data here. 

- Fit `SimpleImputer` on `X_train`.
- Transform `X_train` using the fit `SimpleImputer` to create `X_train_imp`.
- Fit `StandardScaler` on `X_train_imp`.
- Transform `X_train_imp` using the fit `StandardScaler` to create `X_train_imp_scaled`.
- Fit the model (`KNeighborsRegressor` in our case) on `X_train_imp_scaled`.



---

```{python}
pipe.predict(X_train) 
```

```python
X_train_imp = imputer.transform(X_train)
X_train_imp_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train_imp)
knn.predict(X_train_imp_scaled)
```


Notes:

Then when we are passing original data to `predict` the following steps are carrying out:

- Transform `X_train` using the fit `SimpleImputer` to create `X_train_imp`.
- Transform `X_train_imp` using the fit `StandardScaler` to create `X_train_imp_scaled`.
- Predict using the fit model (`KNeighborsRegressor` in our case) on `X_train_imp_scaled`. 

It is not fitting any of the data this time. 

One thing that is awesome with pipelines is that we can't make the mistakes we showed earlier.

Notes: 

Here is a schematic assuming we have two transformers `T1` (in our example, imputation) and `T2` (in our example, standardization).


We call fit on the train split and score on the test split, it's clean.

We can't accidentally re-fit the preprocessor on the test data like we did last time.

It automatically makes sure the same transformations are applied to train and test.

When we call `pipe.fit()` we are fitting ***and*** transforming our data.


---

```{python}
scores_processed = cross_validate(pipe, X_train, y_train, return_train_score=True)
pd.DataFrame(scores_processed)
```

Notes: 

Remember what cross-validation does - it calls `fit` and `score`.

Now we're calling fit on the pipeline, not just the 𝑘-NN regressor.

So, the transformers and the 𝑘-NN model are refits again on each fold.

The pipeline applies the `fit_transform` on the train portion of the data and only `transform` on the validation portion in each fold.   

This is how to avoid the Golden Rule violation!


---

```{python}
pd.DataFrame(scores_processed).mean()
```

```{python}
dummy = DummyRegressor(strategy="median")
scores = cross_validate(dummy, X_train, y_train, return_train_score=True)
pd.DataFrame(scores).mean()
```

Notes: 

And we can also see that the preprocessed scores are much better than our dummy regressor which has negative ones! 

We can trust here now that the scores are not influenced but the training data and all our steps were done efficiently and easily too.
