# Handling categorical features: binary, ordinal and more

Notes: <br>

---

## Returning to ordinal encoding

```{python }
adult = pd.read_csv('data/adult.csv')
adult = adult.replace("?", np.NaN)
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(adult, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
X_train = train_df.drop(columns=['income'])
y_train = train_df['income']
X_test = test_df.drop(columns=['income'])
y_test = test_df['income']

numeric_features = ["age",
                    "fnlwgt",
                    "education.num",
                    "capital.gain",
                    "capital.loss",
                    "hours.per.week"]

categorical_features = ["workclass",
                        "education", 
                        "marital.status", 
                        "occupation", 
                        "relationship", 
                        "race", 
                        "sex", 
                        "native.country"]
```

```{python}
train_df[categorical_features].head()
```
```{python}
train_df["education"].unique()
```

Notes: 

Taking where we left off with our adult census data, it's a good idea to take a look at the categorical features we specified in more detail. 

Some of the categorical features are truly categorical, meaning that there is no ordinality among values. 

But what about the `education` column? 

Here there is actually an order in the values and it might help to encode this column using `OrdinalEncoder`

- Example: Masters > 10th    


---

```{python}
train_df["education"].unique()
```
```{python}
oe = OrdinalEncoder(dtype=int)
oe.fit(X_train[["education"]]);
ed_transformed = oe.transform(X_train[["education"]])
ed_transformed = pd.DataFrame(data=ed_transformed, columns=["education_enc"], index=X_train.index)
ed_transformed.head()
```
```{python}
ed_transformed['education_enc'].unique()
```



Notes:  Let's use `OrdinalEncoder` and see what happens. 

We fit and then transform the `education` column. 

We now see that we have given each education category a value. 

---

```{python}
oe.categories_[-1]
```

```{python}
pd.DataFrame(data=np.arange(len(oe.categories_[0])), columns=["transformed"], index=oe.categories_[0]).head(10)
```

Notes: 

But which integer value corresponds to each education category?

`OrdinalEncoder` has encoded the categories by alphabetically sorting them and then assigning integers to them in that order.

Is this what we want? 

---

```{python}
train_df["education"].unique()
```

```{python}
education_levels = ['Preschool', '1st-4th', '5th-6th', '7th-8th', 
                    '9th', '10th', '11th', '12th', 'HS-grad',
                    'Prof-school', 'Assoc-voc', 'Assoc-acdm', 
                    'Some-college', 'Bachelors', 'Masters', 'Doctorate']
```


```{python}
assert set(education_levels) == set(train_df["education"].unique())
```

Notes: 

Instead, let's order them manually.

We can use the set datatype that we learned in Programming in Python for Data Science to make sure that each has been accounted for.

---


```{python}
oe = OrdinalEncoder(categories=[education_levels], dtype=int)
oe.fit(X_train[["education"]]);
ed_transformed = oe.transform(X_train[["education"]])
ed_transformed = pd.DataFrame(data=ed_transformed, columns=["education_enc"], index=X_train.index)
oe.categories_
```
```{python}
pd.DataFrame(data=np.arange(len(oe.categories_[0])), columns=["transformed"], index=oe.categories_[0]).head(10)
```



Notes: 

Ah! That looks better. 

---


```{python}
numeric_features = ['age', 'fnlwgt', 'capital.gain', 
                    'capital.loss', 'hours.per.week']
categorical_features = ['workclass', 'marital.status', 'occupation', 
                        'relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'native.country']
ordinal_features = ['education']
target_column = 'income'
```




Notes: 

So now when we are separating our columns into their respective feature types.

---


```{python}
numeric_transformer = make_pipeline(SimpleImputer(strategy="median"), StandardScaler())

categorical_transformer = make_pipeline(
    SimpleImputer(strategy="constant", fill_value="missing"),
    OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore")
)

ordinal_transformer = make_pipeline(
    SimpleImputer(strategy="constant", fill_value="missing"),
    OrdinalEncoder(categories=[education_levels], dtype=int,)
)

preprocessor = make_column_transformer(
        (numeric_transformer, numeric_features),
        (categorical_transformer, categorical_features),
        (ordinal_transformer, ordinal_features)
)
pipe = make_pipeline(preprocessor, SVC())
```



Notes: 

This means that we need to make a separate pipeline for our ordinal columns. We then specify this transformation in or `make_column_transformer()` function.

---

```{python}
scores = cross_validate(pipe, X_train, y_train, return_train_score=True)
pd.DataFrame(scores).mean()
```


Notes: 

This then produces new scores. 

---

## Binary Features


```{python}
X_train.head()
```

```{python}
X_train['sex'].unique()
```


Notes: 

Let's take another look at our columns. 

If we look at the values for `sex`, they were collected in a binary way. 

Note that this representation reflects how the data were collected and is not meant to imply that, for example, gender is binary.



---

```{python}
ohe = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False, dtype=int)
ohe.fit(X_train[["sex"]])
ohe_df = pd.DataFrame(data=ohe.transform(X_train[["sex"]]), columns=ohe.get_feature_names(["sex"]), index=X_train.index)
ohe_df
```


Notes: 

When we do one-hot encoding on this feature, we get 2 separate columns which aren't particularly necessary. 


---


```{python}
ohe = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False, dtype=int, drop="if_binary") # <-- see here
ohe.fit(X_train[["sex"]])
ohe_df = pd.DataFrame(data=ohe.transform(X_train[["sex"]]), columns=ohe.get_feature_names(["sex"]), index=X_train.index)
ohe_df
```


Notes: 

So, for this feature with binary values, we can use an argument called `drop` within `OneHotEncoder` and set it to `"if_binary"`.

Now we see that after one-hot encoding we only get a single column where the encoder has arbitrarily chosen one of the two categories based on the sorting.

In this case, alphabetically it was [Female, Male] and it drops the first one.

---

```{python}
numeric_features = ['age', 'fnlwgt', 'capital.gain', 
                    'capital.loss', 'hours.per.week']
categorical_features = ['workclass', 'marital.status', 'occupation', 
                        'relationship', 'race', 'native.country']
ordinal_features = ['education']
binary_features = ['sex']
target_column = 'income'
```


Notes: 

Again we must separate our binary feature from the rest. 

---

```{python}
numeric_transformer = make_pipeline(SimpleImputer(strategy="median"), StandardScaler())

categorical_transformer = make_pipeline(
    SimpleImputer(strategy="constant", fill_value="missing"),
    OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore")
)
ordinal_transformer = make_pipeline(
    SimpleImputer(strategy="constant", fill_value="missing"),
    OrdinalEncoder(categories=[education_levels], dtype=int,)
)
binary_transformer = make_pipeline(
    SimpleImputer(strategy="constant", fill_value="missing"),
    OneHotEncoder(drop="if_binary", dtype=int)
    )
preprocessor = make_column_transformer(
        (numeric_transformer, numeric_features),
        (categorical_transformer, categorical_features),
        (ordinal_transformer, ordinal_features),
        (binary_transformer, binary_features)
)
pipe = make_pipeline(preprocessor, SVC())
```



Notes: 


And just like we said for ordinal values,  when we make our pipelines, we need to make a separate one for the binary columns and add it to our `make_column_transformer()`.


---

```{python}
scores = cross_validate(pipe, X_train, y_train, return_train_score=True)
pd.DataFrame(scores)
```

```{python}
pd.DataFrame(scores).mean()
```


Notes: 

---

## One-hot encoding with many categories


```{python}
X_train["native.country"].value_counts()
```


Notes: 


This may be too detailed, and the amount of data is very limited for most of these countries.

Can you really learn from 11 examples?

Grouping them into bigger categories such as "South America" or "Asia" or having an "other" category for rare cases could be a better solution.


---

### Do we actually want to use certain features for prediction?

```{python}
X_train.head()
```


```{python}
X_train["race"].unique()
```


Notes: 

Do you want to use `race` in prediction?

Remember that the systems you build are going to be used in some applications. 

It's extremely important to be mindful of the consequences of including certain features in your predictive model. 

Splitting `race` into 4 races and an `Other` group seems quite insensitive and problematic to say the least. 

Dropping the feature to avoid racial biases, would be a strong suggestion.
