# Module Learning Outcomes

By the end of the module, students are expected to:

- Broadly describe how decision trees make predictions.
- Use `DecisionTreeClassifier()` and `DecisionTreeRegressor()` to build decision trees using scikit-learn.
- Explain the fit and predict paradigm and use score method of ML models.
- Explain the concept of decision boundaries.
- Explain the different between parameters and hyperparameters.
- Explain how decision boundaries change with `max_depth`.
- Explain the concept of generalization.
- Split a dataset into train and test sets using `train_test_split()` function.

Notes: 

The assignment will concentrate on the learning objectives as well as building knowledge on existing concepts.
