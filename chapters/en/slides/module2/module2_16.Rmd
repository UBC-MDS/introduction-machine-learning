# Decision Tree Regressor

Notes: <br>

---



```{python}
regression_df = pd.read_csv("data/quiz2-grade-toy-regression.csv")
regression_df
```



Notes: 

We can also use the decision tree algorithm for regression problems. 

Instead of using gini (which we briefly mentioned this in previous slides), we can use <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#mathematical-formulation" target="_blank">some other criteria</a>  for splitting. 
(A common one is mean squared error (MSE) which we will discuss shortly)

`scikit-learn` supports regression using decision trees with `DecisionTreeRegressor()` and the `.fit()` and `.predict()` paradigm that is similar to classification.

Just like when we talked about the baseline Dummy regressor, `.score()` for regression returns somethings called an <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html#sklearn.metrics.r2_score" target="_blank"> 𝑅2  </a>.    

The maximum 𝑅2  is 1 for perfect predictions. 
It can be negative which is very bad (worse than DummyRegressor). 

--- 

```{python}
X = regression_df.drop(columns=["quiz2"])
X.head()
```

```{python}
y = regression_df["quiz2"]
y.head()
```

Notes: 

**Decision Tree Regressor** is built using `DecisionTreeRegressor()` and a similar `.fit()` and `.predict()` paradigms as classification.

We split our data just like we did before into our feature table and our target. 



---

```{python}
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
```


```{python }
depth = 4
reg_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=depth)
reg_model.fit(X, y);
```


Notes: 

Instead of importing `DecisionTreeClassifier`, we import `DecisionTreeRegressor`.

We follow the same steps before and can even set hyperparameters as we did in classification. 

Here when we build our constructor, we are specifying a `max_depth` of 4.

---

```{python include=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
import graphviz
dot_data = export_graphviz(model)
graphviz.Source(
    export_graphviz(
        model4,
        out_file=None,
        feature_names=X.columns,
        class_names=["red", "blue"],
        impurity=True,
    )   
).render("../../../../static/module2/module2_16a", format='png') 
```

```{python include=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
display_tree(X.columns, reg_model, "../../../../static/module2/module2_16a")
```

<center><img src="/module2/module2_16a.png"  width = "68%" alt="404 image" /></center>

    
Notes: 

This time when we predict a single observation, instead of getting a prediction that is a category or class, we are getting a numerical value.


---

```{python}
X.loc[[0]]
```


```{python}
reg_model.predict(X.loc[[0]])
```

Notes: 


Here we see that the model predicts a grade of 90 for the first observation. 

---

```{python}
predicted_grades = reg_model.predict(X)
regression_df = regression_df.assign(predicted_quiz2 = predicted_grades)
print("R^2 score on the training data:" + str(round(reg_model.score(X,y), 3)))
```

```{python}
regression_df.head()
```



Notes: 

Let's see how well this model does predicting the entire data.

We talked in Module 1 how we use a measurement called 𝑅2  to measure the score of regression models. In this case the 𝑅2  score is 1.0,  meaning the model perfectly predicts the outcome of every observation.

This is quite different from what we were getting with a Dummy Classifier which had an 𝑅2  value of 0.
