## Improving the baseline model



Examples:

<center><img src="/module2/quiz2-grade-toy.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" /></center>


Notes: 

So we have built a baseline model, but can we do better than that? 



We're going to bring back this data set that we saw previously which is the classification dataset for whether or not a student will get an A+ on the second quiz given that there are multiple other columns here. 


If you are asked to write a program to predict whether a student gets an A+ or not in quiz2, how would you go for it? 

In our dummy model we only predicted the most occurring value in this Quiz 2 column on our new test data, so for example, if A+  was most occurring,  then on any new test data, it would just predict A+ no matter what all of these other column values were. 

We have all of these features that we could use to help with our predictions. To make things initially more understandable, we are going to change our dataset a little bit so they are expressed in binary values.  1 = yes and 0 = no or 1=A+ 0=Not A+.

## A program for prediction using a set of rules with *if/else* statements 


<center>
<img src="/module2/quiz2-grade-toy.png" height="600" width="600"> 
</center>


- How about a rule-based algorithm with several *if/else* statements?  
```
if class attendance == 1 and quiz1 == 1:
    quiz2 == "A+"
elif class attendance == 1 and lab3 == 1 and lab4 == 1:
    quiz2 == "A+"
...
```

Notes: 

Now that we have a model where our features are 1 of 2 options, how about we have a rule-based algorithm with several *if/else* statements?  
We learned about conditions and *if/else* statements in module 5 of ***Programming in Python for Data Science***, now let's incorporate this concept into a machine learning problem. 

Looking at the first example we have `class_attendance=1` and `quiz1=1` as well. That gives us in our training data an A+ as the target. We could write a rule where if   `class_attendance=1` and `quiz1=1`  we predict quiz2 =A+ since there are no other examples in the data. 

In our next example, we could make an if-else statement where  `class_attendance=1` and `lab3=1` and `lab4=1` then quiz2=A+ since there are no other examples in this dataset. 

```
if class attendance == 1 and quiz1 == 1:
    quiz2 == "A+"
elif class attendance == 1 and lab3 == 1 and lab4 == 1:
    quiz2 == "A+"
...
```

We can continue making these rules until we have many rules. 

Since we have 7 features each with 2 possibilities, the total possible different rules could be 128 different statements but neither of us wants to write all these, which is where decision trees come into play. 

---

```{python}
classification_df = pd.read_csv("data/quiz2-grade-toy-classification.csv")
classification_df.head(3)
```


```{python}
X = classification_df.drop(columns=["quiz2"])
X.head(3)
```

```{python}
y = classification_df["quiz2"]
y.head(3)
```


Notes: 

Let's take our 𝑋 and 𝑦 from our `quiz2` data that we had before.


---

```{python}
X_binary = X.copy()
columns = ["lab1", "lab2", "lab3", "lab4", "quiz1"]
for col in columns:
    X_binary[col] = X_binary[col].apply(
        lambda x: 1 if x >= 90 else 0)
X_binary.head()    
```


Notes: 

Now let's binarize the features in `X` as we discussed. Don’t worry too much about this code. 

We can see that each column now only has a value of either `0` or `1`. 

Now that we have this data in a preferred way we can try and make our predictions with rules and that's where our decision trees come in.

Notes: 

The decision tree models use an algorithm that derives such rules from data in a principled way.

## Decision trees terminology

Note: 


Before we go forward with learning about decision tree classifiers and reggressors we need to understand the structure of a decision tree.
Here is the key terminology that you will have to know: 

- **Root**: Where we start making our conditions.
- **Branch**:  A branch connects to the next node (statement). Each branch represents either true or false.
- **Internal node**: conditions within the tree.  
- **Leaf**: the value predicted from the conditions. 
- **Tree depth**: The longest path from the root to a leaf.

With the decision tree algorithm in machine learning, the tree can have at most two **nodes** resulting from it, also known as **children**. 

This tree would have a depth of 2.

Note: 

Using our quiz2 dataset as an example, a tree may look something like this. 

This tree has a depth of 3. 

Trees do not need to be balanced.

Note: 

This tree has a depth of 1. 

A decision tree that has a depth of 1 is called a ***decision stump***.
