# Module Learning Outcomes

Notes: In this module you will be introduced to the decision trees, their structure and how they make predictions. You will learn the difference between hyperparameters and parameters and be introduced to the concept of generalization.

# Module Learning Outcomes

By the end of the module, students are expected to:

- Broadly describe how decision trees make predictions.
- Use `DecisionTreeClassifier()` and `DecisionTreeRegressor()` to build decision trees using scikit-learn.
- Explain the `.fit()` and `.predict()` paradigm and use `.score()` method of ML models.
- Explain the concept of decision boundaries.
- Explain the different between parameters and hyperparameters.
- Explain how decision boundaries change with `max_depth`.
- Explain the concept of generalization.
