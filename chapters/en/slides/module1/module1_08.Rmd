# Tabular Data and Terminology

Notes: <br>

## Terminology

Here is some basic terminology used in ML:

- **examples** = rows = samples = records = instances (usually denoted by $n$)
- **features** = inputs = predictors = explanatory variables = regressors = independent variables = covariates (usually denoted by $d$) 
- **targets** = outputs = outcomes = response variable = dependent variable = labels (if categorical).
- **training** = learning = fitting

Notes: 

How do we effectively represent what we **input** into our model?

In supervised machine learning,  we typically work with ***tabular data***.    

- Rows are ***examples*** 
- Columns are ***features*** and one of the columns is typically the ***target***. 

- Features are relevant characteristics of the problem (usually suggested by experts).  
- To a machine, column names (features) have no meaning. Only feature values and how they vary across examples mean something. 

- **Training** a model can also be called learning or fitting a model. 

All of these will be used in the course so it's important to get familiar with the vocabulary now. 

You will see a lot of variable terminology in machine learning and statistics and sometimes they can be confusing. See the MDS terminology resource <a href="https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/terminology/" target="_blank">here</a> to clear up any confusions.

### Terminology

### Example 1: Tabular data for the housing price prediction problem
```{python}
df = pd.read_csv("data/kc_house_data.csv")
df = df.drop(["id", "date"], axis=1)
df.head(3)

```



```{python}
df.shape
```


Notes: 

In this example, there are 18 **features** and 21613 **examples**.

The target, in this case, is `price`.


---

### Example 2: Tabular data for quiz2 classification problem
```{python}
classification_df = pd.read_csv("data/quiz2-grade-toy-classification.csv")
classification_df.head(3)
```

```{python}
classification_df.shape
```


Notes: 

Here , there are 7 **features**, which are the columns `ml_experience` to `quiz1`. 

The **target** is `quiz2`. 

After using `.shape` we can see that there are 21 **examples**. 


---

```{python}
X = classification_df.drop(["quiz2"], axis=1)
y = classification_df["quiz2"]
X.head()
```


```{python}
y.head()
```


Notes: 

In order to train a model, we need to separate our data into **features** and the **target**. 

We save our **features** which are columns `ml_experience` to `quiz1` in an object named `X`. 

Our **target**  column is `quiz2`  and gets saved in an object named `y`. 

We will explain why we do this in the next set of slides.
