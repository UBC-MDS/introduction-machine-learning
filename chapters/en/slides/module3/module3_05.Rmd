# Train, validation and test split

Notes: 

We've talked about how it's beneficial to the generalization of our model to split our data into a `train` and a `test` set so we can see how well the model performs on data it has not seen.

We've also talked about hyperparameter tuning.

We do not want to use the test set for this because in that case it will no longer truly be "unseen data".

It's a good idea to have separate data for tuning the hyperparameters of a model that is not the test test so that we obtain a model that generalizes in the best possible way.

This additional data split is called the ***validation*** set. 

So we actually want to split our dataset into 3 splits: train, validation, and test.

We can use the validation data for model tuning (e.g. selecting hyperparameters) and the test data for a final, "pure" model assessment.

### Train/validation/test split

<br>

- **Validation**
- **Train**
- **Test**



Notes: 

Before going forward, it's important that you know that there isn't good concensus on the terminology of what is validation and what is test. 

We will try to use "validation" to refer to data where we have access to the target values, but unlike the training data, we only use this for hyperparameter tuning and model assessment; we don't pass these into `fit`.  

We will try to use "test" to refer to data where we have access to the target values, but in this case, unlike training and validation data, we neither use it in training nor hyperparameter optimization. 

We only use test data **once** to evaluate the performance of the best performing model on the validation set.   

We lock it in a "vault" until we're ready to evaluate.

## Deployment data


<center><img src="/module3/deployment.jpg"  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

After we build and finalize a model, we deploy it, and then the model deals with the data in the wild. 

We will use "deployment" to refer to this data, where we do **not** have access to the target values.

Deployment error is the thing we _really_ care about.

We use validation and test errors as proxies for deployment error, and we hope they are similar.

So, if our model does well on the validation and test data, we hope it will do well on deployment data.

|         | `fit` | `score` | `predict` |
|----------|-------|---------|-----------|
| Train    | ✔️      | ✔️      | ✔️         |
| Validation |      | ✔️      | ✔️         |
| Test    |       |  once   | once         |
| Deployment    |       |       | ✔️         |

We can typically expect  **𝐸_𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛<𝐸_𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛<_𝐸_𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡<𝐸_𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑦𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡**.
