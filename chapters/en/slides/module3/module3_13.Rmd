# Overfitting and underfitting

Notes: <br>

---

We're going to think about 3 types of errors:

- **score_train**:  is our training score (or mean train score from cross-validation).

<br>

- **score_valid**  is our validation score (or mean validation score from cross-validation).

<br>

- **score_test**  is our test score.



Notes: 

We've talked about the different types of splits but we've only briefly discussed scores and the different types of scores that we receive when building models. 

We saw in cross-validation that there was train and validation scores and what happens if they did not align with each other.

How do we diagnose the problem? 

We're going to think about 3 types of scores:

- **score_train**:  is our training score (or mean train score from cross-validation).
- **score_valid**  is our validation score (or mean validation score  from cross-validation).
- **score_test**  is our test score

---

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv("data/canada_usa_cities.csv")
X = df.drop(columns=["country"])
y = df["country"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)
```

Notes: 

Let's bring back our Canadian and United States cities' data to help explain the concepts of overfitting and underfitting.
 
---

## Overfitting

```python
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
scores = cross_validate(model, X_train, y_train, cv=10, return_train_score=True)
print("Train score: " + str(round(scores["train_score"].mean(), 2)))
print("Validation score: " + str(round(scores["test_score"].mean(), 2)))
```

```out
Train score: 1.0
Validation score: 0.81
```

```{python echo=FALSE, fig.width = 13, fig.height = 8,  out.width = '70%'}
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X, y);
plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4))
plot_classifier(X.to_numpy(), y.to_numpy(), model)
plt.title("Decision tree with no max_depth")
```

Notes: 

Using a decision tree with no specified max_depth, we can explain the phenomenon is called ***overfitting***. 

Overfitting is when our model fits the training data well and therefore the training score is high, however, the model does not generalize to the validation set as well and the validation error is much higher. 

The Train score is high but the validation score is much lower.

The gap between the train and validation scores is bigger.

A standard overfitting scenario would be: **Score_train>>Score_valid**

If **Score_train** is high, then we are in an overfitting scenario. It is fairly common to have at least a bit of this.
 

---

## Underfitting 

```python
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1)

scores = cross_validate(model, X_train, y_train, cv=10, return_train_score=True)
print("Train score: " + str(round(scores["train_score"].mean(), 2)))
print("Validation score: " + str(round(scores["test_score"].mean(), 2)))
```

```out
Train score: 0.83
Validation score: 0.81
```

```{python echo=FALSE, fig.width = 13, fig.height = 8,  out.width = '70%'}

model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1)
model.fit(X,y);
plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4))
plot_classifier(X.to_numpy(), y.to_numpy(), model)
plt.title("Decision tree with max_depth=1")
```

Notes: 

Using a decision tree with a max_depth of 1, we can explain the phenomenon is called ***underfitting***. 

Underfitting is when our model is too simple (`DecisionTreeClassifier` with max_depth=1 or `DummyClassifier`). 

The model doesn't capture the patterns in the training data and the training score is not that high.

The model doesn't fit the data well and hence **Score_valid≲Score_train**.
 
Both train and validation scores are bad and the gap between train and validation scores is lower.

**<Score_valid≲Score_train**

Standard question to ask ourselves: 
***Which of these scenarios am I in?***

### How can we figure this out?

Score_train and Score_valid.

- If they are very far apart → more likely **overfitting**.     
    - Try decreasing model complexity.

- If they are very close together → more likely **underfitting**.  
    - Try increasing model complexity.
