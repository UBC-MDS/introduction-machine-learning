# Distances

Notes: 

How do we calculate the similarity between examples? 

One way to calculate the similarity between two points in high dimensional space is by calculating the distance between them. 

So, if the distance is higher, that means that the points are less similar and when the distance is smaller, that means that the points are more similar.

## Distance between vectors



**Euclidean distance**: Euclidean distance is a measure of the true straight line distance between two points in Euclidean space.(<a href="https://hlab.stanford.edu/brian/euclidean_distance_in.html" target="_blank">source </a>)

The Euclidean distance between vectors     
     
<img src="/module4/u.png" alt="A caption" width="18%" />           
and       
    
<img src="/module4/v.png" alt="A caption" width="18%" />        
         
is defined as:

Notes:

A common way to calculate the distance between two points in high dimensional space is by using Euclidean distance. 

The formula to calculate Euclidean distance is shown. 

Given two vectors or two features vectors, in our case, we are assuming we have two feature vectors named 𝑢 and 𝑣. 

The Euclidean distance between them is defined by the square root of the summation of the squared element-wise differences between these two factors (A mouthful, we know, we will look at the steps in the next few slides).


----

```{python}
cities_df = pd.read_csv("data/canada_usa_cities.csv")
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(cities_df, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)
train_df.head()
```



Notes: 

Let's return to the cities dataset that we have been working with. 

As a reminder, the data set has two features: `longitude` and `latitude` and we are trying to predict if the city is in the USA or Canada. 


---

```{python}
cities_viz = alt.Chart(train_df, width=500, height=300).mark_circle(size=20, opacity=0.6).encode(
    alt.X('longitude:Q', scale=alt.Scale(domain=[-140, -40])),
    alt.Y('latitude:Q', scale=alt.Scale(domain=[20, 60])),
    alt.Color('country:N', scale=alt.Scale(domain=['Canada', 'USA'],
                                           range=['red', 'blue']))
)
cities_viz
```

```{python include =FALSE}
cities_viz.save(path + 'cities_viz.png')
```

<img src="/module4/cities_viz.png" alt="A caption" width="66%" />

Notes: 

Here is the plot showing Canadian cities in red and American cities in blue.

---

```{python}
two_cities = cities_df.sample(2, random_state=42).drop(columns=["country"])
two_cities
```

<img src="/module4/cities_distance.png" alt="A caption" width="70%" />


Notes: 

Let's take 2 points (two feature vectors) from the cities dataset.

The two sampled points are shown as black circles.

Our goal is to find how similar these two points are.

### How do we calculate the distance between the two cities?

```{python}
two_cities
```


Subtract the two cities:

```{python}
two_cities.iloc[1] - two_cities.iloc[0]
```
Square the differences:
```{python}
(two_cities.iloc[1] - two_cities.iloc[0])**2
```

Notes: 

How do we calculate the distance between these two points (two cities)?

Let's calculate the Euclidean distance between these two cities so here are our two cities.

The first step is to subtract these two cities. 
We are subtracting the city at index 0 from the city at index 1. 

Next, we square the differences. 

---


Sum them up:

```{python}
((two_cities.iloc[1] - two_cities.iloc[0])**2).sum()
```

And then take the square root:

```{python}
np.sqrt(np.sum((two_cities.iloc[1] - two_cities.iloc[0])**2))

```


Notes: 

Our third step is summing up the squared differences. 

Then finally we take the square root of the value.

This results in a value of 13.3898 which is the distance between the two cities. 


---


```{python}
np.sqrt(np.sum((two_cities.iloc[1] - two_cities.iloc[0])**2))

```


```{python}
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import euclidean_distances
```


```{python}
euclidean_distances(two_cities)
```

Notes: 


`sklearn` has a function called `euclidean_distances` that we could use instead of going through each of the steps on the previous slide. 

When we call this function on our two cities data, it outputs this matrix with four values.

- Our first value is the distance between city 0 and itself. 
- Our second value is the distance between city 0 and city1. 
- Our third value is the distance between city 1and city 0.
- Our fourth value is the distance between city 1 and itself.

As we can see, the distances are symmetric. If we calculate the distance between city 0 and city, it’s going to have the same value as if we calculated the distance between city 1 and city 0.

This isn’t always the case if we use a different metric to calculate distances.
