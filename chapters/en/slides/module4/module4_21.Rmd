# 𝑘 -Nearest Neighbours Regressor

## Regression with  𝑘 -nearest neighbours ( 𝑘 -NNs)



```{python}
np.random.seed(0)
n = 50
X_1 = np.linspace(0,2,n)+np.random.randn(n)*0.01
X = pd.DataFrame(X_1[:,None], columns=['length'])
X.head()
```

```{python}
y = np.random.randn(n,1) + X_1[:,None]*5
y = pd.DataFrame(y, columns=['weight'])
y.head()
```



Notes: 

We can solve regression problems with  𝑘 -nearest neighbours algorithm as well. 

In KNN regression we take the average of the  𝑘 -nearest neighbours.

Let's say we have a toy dataset with a single feature and 50 examples.

For this, we are going to make up a dataset. Let's say our feature is the length of a snake and we want to predict the weight of it. 

(You do not need to worry about the code here)

---

```{python}
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)

```

```{python}
source = pd.concat([X_train, y_train], axis=1)

scatter = alt.Chart(source, width=500, height=300).mark_point(filled=True, color='green').encode(
    alt.X('length:Q'),
    alt.Y('weight:Q'))

scatter
```

```{python include =FALSE}
scatter.save(path + 'snakes.png')
```

Notes:

Let's split up our data so we do not break the golden rule of machine learning.

Then we can plot our training data. 


---

```{python}
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor
```

```{python}
knnr = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=1, weights="uniform")
knnr.fit(X_train,y_train);
```

```{python}
predicted = knnr.predict(X_train)
predicted[:5]
```

```{python}
knnr.score( X_train, y_train)  
```



Notes: 

Let's first import  `KNeighborsRegressor`.

We train our model just like before and predict, this time expecting a numerical value as a target. 

When we score it, we get a 100% training score and you'll see why in the next graph.

Notes: 

---

```{python}
knnr = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=10, weights="uniform")
knnr.fit(X_train, y_train);
```

```{python}
knnr.score(X_train, y_train)
```



<center><img src="/module4/snakes_10.png" alt="A caption" width="55%" /></center>

Notes: 

Let's see what happens when we use 𝑘=10.

Our accuracy decreases on our training data and we can see that our gold line is not intersecting all the points and is not as close to the actual value as before. 

---

## Using weighted distances

```{python}
knnr = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=10, weights="distance")
knnr.fit(X_train, y_train);
```

```{python}
knnr.score(X_train, y_train)
```

<center><img src="/module4/snakes_weighted.png" alt="A caption" width="55%" /></center>

Notes: 

We can also specify our `weights` parameter so that points that are closer, have more meaning to the prediction than points that are further away.

## Pros and Cons of 𝑘 -Nearest Neighbours

<br>
<br>

### Pros:

- Easy to understand, interpret.
- Simply hyperparameter  𝑘 (`n_neighbors`)controlling the fundamental tradeoff.
- Can learn very complex functions given enough data.
- Lazy learning: Takes no time to `fit`

<br>

### Cons:

- Can potentially be VERY slow during prediction time. 
- Often not that great test accuracy compared to the modern approaches.
- You should scale your features. We'll be looking into it in the next lecture.
