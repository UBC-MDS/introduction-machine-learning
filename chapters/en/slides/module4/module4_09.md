# Finding the nearest neighbour

Notes:

Now that we know how to calculate the distance between two points, we
are ready to find the most similar examples.

---

``` python
cities_df = pd.read_csv("data/canada_usa_cities.csv")
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(cities_df, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)
train_df.head(3)
```

```out
     longitude  latitude country
160   -76.4813   44.2307  Canada
127   -81.2496   42.9837  Canada
169   -66.0580   45.2788  Canada
```

``` python
dists = euclidean_distances(train_df[["latitude", "longitude"]])
dists
```

```out
array([[ 0.        ,  4.92866046, 10.47586257, ..., 45.36619339,  3.13968038,  9.58476504],
       [ 4.92866046,  0.        , 15.36399019, ..., 40.48484175,  1.80868018, 14.45684087],
       [10.47586257, 15.36399019,  0.        , ..., 55.83947468, 13.60621684,  0.94361393],
       ...,
       [45.36619339, 40.48484175, 55.83947468, ...,  0.        , 42.23325838, 54.93872568],
       [ 3.13968038,  1.80868018, 13.60621684, ..., 42.23325838,  0.        , 12.70774745],
       [ 9.58476504, 14.45684087,  0.94361393, ..., 54.93872568, 12.70774745,  0.        ]])
```

``` python
dists.shape
```

```out
(167, 167)
```

Notes:

Let’s look at the distances from all the cities to all other cities in
our training portion of our city’s data.

This is going to be of shape 167 by 167 as this was the number of
examples in our training portion.

Each row here gives us the distance of that particular city to all other
cities in the training data.

---

``` python
pd.DataFrame(dists).loc[:5,:5]
```

```out
           0          1          2          3          4          5
0   0.000000   4.928660  10.475863   3.402295   9.046000  44.329135

```

``` python
np.fill_diagonal(dists, np.inf)
pd.DataFrame(dists).loc[:5,:5]
```

```out
           0          1          2          3          4          5
0        inf   4.928660  10.475863   3.402295   9.046000  44.329135
1   4.928660        inf  15.363990   8.326614  13.965788  39.839439
2  10.475863  15.363990        inf   7.195350   2.653738  54.549042
3   3.402295   8.326614   7.195350        inf   5.643921  47.391337
4   9.046000  13.965788   2.653738   5.643921        inf  52.532333
5  44.329135  39.839439  54.549042  47.391337  52.532333        inf
```

Notes:

Note that we are replacing these diagonal entries by infinity in the
matrix.

The distance of each city to itself is going to be zero.

If we don’t replace 0 with infinity, each city’s most similar city is
going to be itself which is not useful.

---

Feature vector for city 0:

``` python
train_df.iloc[0]
```

```out
longitude   -76.4813
latitude     44.2307
country       Canada
Name: 160, dtype: object
```

Distances from city 0 to 5 other cities:

``` python
dists[0][:5]
```

```out
array([        inf,  4.92866046, 10.47586257,  3.40229467,  9.04600003])
```

Notes:

Now let’s look at the distance between city 0 and some other cities.

We can look at city 0 with its respective `longitude` and `latitude`
values.

Here, we are printing the distances from city 0 to 5 other cities in the
training dataset.

Remember that our goal is to find the closest example.

So, in our case, we want to find the closest example to city 0.

We can find the closest city to city 0 by finding the city with the
minimum distance.

---

``` python
train_df.iloc[[0]]
```

```out
     longitude  latitude country
160   -76.4813   44.2307  Canada
```

``` python
np.argmin(dists[0])
```

```out
157
```

``` python
train_df.iloc[[157]]
```

```out
    longitude  latitude country
96   -76.3019    44.211  Canada
```

``` python
dists[0][157]
```

```out
0.1804783920605758
```

Notes:

So, we take
<a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.argmin.html" target="_blank">`np.argmin`</a>
to find the city with the minimum distance from city 0.

The closest city in our case turned out to be the city with index 157
from our training dataset ( this corresponds to the index 96 from the
original dataset before shuffling).

If we look at the `longitude` and `latitude` values for the city at
index 157 (labeled 96), they look pretty close to those of city 0.

So, in this case, the closest city to city 0 is city 157 and the
Euclidean distance between the two cities is 0.184.

### Finding the distances to a query point

``` python
query_point = [[-80, 25]]
```

``` python
dists = euclidean_distances(train_df[["longitude", "latitude"]], query_point)
dists[0:5]
```

```out
array([[19.54996348],
       [18.02706204],
       [24.60912622],
       [21.39718237],
       [25.24111312]])
```

We can find the city closest to the query point (-80, 25) using:

``` python
np.argmin(dists)
```

```out
147
```

The distance between the query point and closest city is:

``` python
dists[np.argmin(dists)].item()
```

```out
3.8383922936564634
```

Notes:

Next, let’s find the distances to a given query point.

Before we were calculating the distances between all the cities in our
training dataset to all other cities in the same set.

But what if instead, we are given this new query point which does not
occur in our training data.

So, suppose we have the query point with a longitude value of -80 and a
latitude value of 25.

We want to find the training example that’s most similar to this query
point.

How can we do that?

First, we calculate the distances from a credit point to all examples in
our training set.

We are showing the distances of our query point to the first five cities
in our training data.

Next, we find out which city from our training data the query point is
closest to.

It turns out that the city at index 147 is close to our point with the
Euclidean distance between the two equal to 3.838.

---

``` python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
nn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=1)
nn.fit(train_df[['longitude', 'latitude']]);
nn.kneighbors([[-80, 25]])
```

```out
(array([[3.83839229]]), array([[147]]))
```

Notes:

We use Sklearn’s `NearestNeighbors` function to get the closest example
and the distance between the query point and the closest example.

First, we create our “class” object (we can specify the number of
closest neighbours we wish to find), we train on it, and then we can
pass our query example to our object to return the closest number of
examples along with the distances.

And we could also extend it to points in multi-dimensional space.

All this matches our intuition of “distance” in the real world.

``` python
pokemon_df = pd.read_csv("data/pokemon.csv")
X = pokemon_df.drop(columns = ['deck_no', 'name','total_bs', 'type', 'legendary'])
y = pokemon_df[['legendary']]
X_train, X_test, y_train,  y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)

X_train.head()
```

```out
     attack  defense  sp_attack  sp_defense  speed  capture_rt  gen
362      40       50         55          50     25         255    3
132      55       50         45          65     55          45    1
704      75       53         83         113     60          45    6
9        30       35         20          20     45         255    1
687      52       67         39          56     50         120    6
```

Note:

Let’s find the nearest neighbours in our Pokémon dataset.

---

``` python
dists = euclidean_distances(X_train[:3])
dists
```

```out
array([[  0.        , 213.4338305 , 226.54138695],
       [213.4338305 ,   0.        ,  64.86139067],
       [226.54138695,  64.86139067,   0.        ]])
```

``` python
dists[0,2]
```

```out
226.54138694728607
```

``` python
nn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=1)
nn.fit(X_train);
nn.kneighbors(X_test.iloc[[1]])
```

```out
(array([[15.5241747]]), array([[143]]))
```

``` python
X_test.to_numpy().shape
```

```out
(161, 7)
```

Notes:

The distance between Pokémon zero and Pokémon 2 can be found using the
indexing of `dists[0,2]`.

We can find the most similar Pokemon from our training data to Pokemon 1
from the test set using the `NearestNeighbors` function from the Sklearn
library.

---

``` python
nn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=5)
nn.fit(X_train);
nn.kneighbors(X_test.iloc[1])
```

``` out
ValueError: Expected 2D array, got 1D array instead:
array=[605  55  55  85  55  30 255 335   5].
Reshape your data either using array.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or array.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample.
```

``` python
X_test.iloc[1].shape
```

```out
(7,)
```

``` python
X_test.iloc[[1]].shape
```

```out
(1, 7)
```

``` python
nn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=5)
nn.fit(X_train);
nn.kneighbors(X_test.iloc[[1]])
```

```out
(array([[15.5241747 , 25.90366769, 27.91057147, 33.3166625 , 34.69870315]]), array([[143, 364, 515, 638,   0]]))
```

Notes:

Now let’s find the 5 most similar Pokémon from the training data to our
test Pokémon.

We need to be careful here though because we need to make sure we pass
in a 2D NumPy array as an input.

We can see the top 5 most similar Pokémon to our test example.
