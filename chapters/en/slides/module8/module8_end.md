- Use `scikit-learn`'s `LogisticRegression` classifier.
    - Use `fit`, `predict` and `predict_proba`.   
    - Use `coef_` to interpret the model weights.
- Explain the advantages and limitations of linear classifiers. 
- Apply scikit-learn regression model (e.g., Ridge) to regression problems.
- Relate the Ridge hyperparameter `alpha` to the `LogisticRegression` hyperparameter `C`.
