# Logistic regression

Notes: <br>

---

```{python}
cities_df = pd.read_csv("data/canada_usa_cities.csv")
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(cities_df, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)
X_train, y_train = train_df.drop(columns=["country"], axis=1), train_df["country"]
X_test, y_test = test_df.drop(columns=["country"], axis=1), test_df["country"]

train_df.head()
```


Notes: 

Next, we are going to introduce to you a new model called **logistic regression**. 

It's very similar to the `Ridge` classifier we sae earlier but this one has some key differences. 

For one, we can use it with classification instead of regression problems. 

For that reason we are going to bring back our cities dataset we saw at the beginning of this course. 



---

## Setting the stage

```{python}
from sklearn.dummy import DummyClassifier
dc = DummyClassifier(strategy="prior")

scores= pd.DataFrame(cross_validate(dc, X_train, y_train, return_train_score=True))
scores
```



Notes: 

Although we don't always do this in the slides, we should always be building a baseline model before we do any type of meaningful modelling. 

Let's do that before we get straight into it.

Now we can have a better idea on how well our model performs. 

---

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
```


```{python}
lr = LogisticRegression()
scores = pd.DataFrame(cross_validate(lr, X_train, y_train, return_train_score=True))
scores
```


Notes: 

We import `LogisticRegression` from the `sklearn.linear_model` library like we did with `Ridge`. 

This time we can see that our training and cross-validation scores have increased from those of our `DummyClassifier`. 



---

## Visualizing our model

```{python echo=FALSE,  fig.width = 13, fig.height = 9,  out.width = '80%', fig.align='center'}
lr.fit(X_train, y_train);
plot_classifier(X_train, y_train, lr, ax=plt.gca(), ticks=True)
plt.xticks(fontsize= 14);
plt.yticks(fontsize= 14);
plt.title("Logistic Regression", fontsize=20)
plt.xlabel("longitude", fontsize=16)
plt.ylabel("lattitude", fontsize=16)
```



Notes: 

We saw that with SVMs and decision trees we could visualize our model with decision boundaries and we can do the same thing here.

Here we can see we get a line that separates our two target classes.

```{python include=FALSE,  fig.width = 12, fig.height = 10,  out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
models = {
    "KNN": KNeighborsClassifier(),    
    "RBF SVM": SVC(gamma = 0.01),    
    "Logistic Regression": LogisticRegression()
}

plt.figure(figsize=(20, 4))
i = 0
for name, model in models.items():    
    plt.subplot(1, 4, i + 1)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    plot_classifier(X_train, y_train, model, ax=plt.gca())
    plt.xticks();
    plt.yticks();
    plt.title(name, fontsize=14)
    plt.xlabel("longitude")
    plt.ylabel("lattitude")
    i += 1
```

<center><img src="/module8/triple_graph.png"  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes:

If we look at some other models that we did this in comparison for you can understand a bit more on why we call Logistic Regression a "linear Classifiers". 

Notice a linear decision boundary (a line in our case).


---

# Coefficients

```{python}
lr = LogisticRegression()
lr.fit(X_train, y_train); 
```

```python
print("Model weights:", lr.coef_)
print("Model intercept:", lr.intercept_)
```

```out
Model weights: [[-0.04108149 -0.33683126]]
Model intercept: [10.8869838]
```

```{python}
data = {'features': X_train.columns, 'coefficients':lr.coef_[0]}
pd.DataFrame(data)
```


Notes: 

Just like we saw for `Ridge`. we can get the equation of that line and the coefficients of our `latitude` and `longitude` features using `.coef_`.

In this case we see that both are negative weights, 

We also can see that the weight of latitude is larger in magnitude. 

This makes a lot of sense because Canada as a country lies above the USA and so we expect `latitude` values to contribute more to a prediction than `longitude` which Canada and the `USA` have quite similar values. 


---

## Predictions

```{python}
example = X_test.iloc[0,:]
example.tolist()
```


```{python}
lr.intercept_ + (example.tolist() * lr.coef_).sum(axis=1)
```
```{python}
lr.predict([example])
```


Notes: 

Again let's take an example from our test and calculate the outcome using our weights and intercept. 

We get a value of -1.978. 

In `Ridge` our prediction would be the calculated result so -1.97, but for logistic regression we check the **sign** of the calculation only.

Our threshold is 0.
- If the result was positive, it predicts the one class; if negative, it predict the other.

That means everything negative corresponds to "Canada" and everything positive predicts a class of "USA". 

If we use `predict`, it gives us the same result as well! 

These are "hard predictions" but we can also use this for something called "soft predictions" as well (That's in the next slide deck!). 

---

## Hyperparameter: C (A new one)


```{python }
scores_dict ={
"C" :10.0**np.arange(-6,2,1),
"train_score" : list(),
"cv_score" : list(),
}
for C in scores_dict['C']:
    lr_model = LogisticRegression(C=C)
    results = cross_validate(lr_model, X_train, y_train, return_train_score=True)
    scores_dict['train_score'].append(results["train_score"].mean())
    scores_dict['cv_score'].append(results["test_score"].mean())
```

```{python}
pd.DataFrame(scores_dict)
```


Notes: 

At this point you should be feeling pretty comfortable with hyperparameters. 

We saw that `Ridge` has the hyperparameter `alpha`, well `C` (annoyingly) has the opposite effect on the fundamental trade off. 

In general, we say smaller `C` leads to a less complex model (whereas with `Ridge`, lower `alpha` means higher complexity). 

higher values of `C` leads to more overfitting and lower values to less overfitting.

```{python include =FALSE}
plotting_source = pd.DataFrame(scores_dict).melt(id_vars='C', 
                                  value_vars=['train_score', 'cv_score'], 
                                  var_name='score_type' ,
                                  value_name= 'accuracy' )
                                  
                                  
mss_acc_plot = alt.Chart(plotting_source, width=500, height=300).mark_line().encode(
    alt.X('C:Q',scale=alt.Scale(type='log')),
    alt.Y('accuracy:Q', scale=alt.Scale(domain=[0.55, 0.9])),
    alt.Color('score_type:N')
).properties(title="Accuracies of C split for logistic regression").to_json()

```

```{r include=FALSE, fig.width = 13, fig.height = 8,  out.width = '80%', fig.align='center'}
as_vegaspec(py$mss_acc_plot)
``` 

```{python}
param_grid = {
    "C": scipy.stats.uniform(0, 100)}

lr = LogisticRegression()
grid_search = RandomizedSearchCV(lr, param_grid, cv=5, return_train_score=True, verbose=1, n_jobs=-1)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train);
``` 

```{python}
grid_search.best_params_
grid_search.best_score_
```

`LogisticRegression`'s default `C` hyperparameter is 1. 

Let's see what kind of value we get if we do `RandomizedGrid`.
